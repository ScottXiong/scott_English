Sorry - one more question.<br>

Hi Maggie,<br>

We’re received a request from Walmart Canada on GlitterBeachBall_AT6148B- they felt the warnings take up too much space on the front of the box. So, they have a couple requests - but we felt it would be best to check with you before proceeding on these revisions, as you may have legal requirements.<br>

1. Walmart asks if it is OK to remove the CHOKING warning from the front panel, since it appears on the back. <br>

2. Walmart also asks if the “NOT A LIFESAVING DEVICE” statement can be moved to the side panels.<br>

I have left a comment on pdf, please update accordingly and for our record. <br>

Please note:  Our approval of the files is for the graphic consistency with Walmart’s style guide/modular look! You still need to send artwork to the testing agency for approval for any legal/compliance issues. Our approval does not mean the file is approved as far as compliance for Warnings, Dimensions, Ingredients, or any other legal requirement. Our approval only means it meets the graphic requirements provided by Walmart. <br>
