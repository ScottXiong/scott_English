Hi Susan,
I have a couple of questions from this file:
Could you please explain what "low-nap" and "tight microweave construction" is? Any reference will be appreciated!

I’m not sure I can explain it. The material is soft with not much of a raised (fuzzy) surface and yet tightly weaved for strength. Here is the previous translation of this – without the word “stretch” which is what was added to the original wording below:
La solidité et le silence hors du commun offerts par ce matériau en polyester peigné sont obtenus grâce à sa conception en microfibres à poils courts tissées serrées. 
Hope that helps,

Haley listed CREATIVE DESIGN LIMITED as a “Harvest” supplier.  Please confirm if this is the same or different company than Creative Converting (Hoffmaster).

One question on this form - the column F - "Product Name to be displayed on packaging” - each item has the word “Canadiana” in it. Normally we don’t use the season/brand name in descriptions. Can these be removed?

Hello again Amit

Sorry - one more question.

There are two ways the background graphic could be handled on the Lint Roller. Please see the attached screenshot. (I know you haven’t selected the blue or green version - but this question would apply to either version)

Should the graphic be repeated twice, like example B, with the center of the burst in the center of each panel? Or just once, like example A? The examples we sent yesterday have it like A…   B seems more logical, but more busy visually.

I got the file and appreciate your help.

Hi Maggie,

We’re received a request from Walmart Canada on GlitterBeachBall_AT6148B- they felt the warnings take up too much space on the front of the box. So, they have a couple requests - but we felt it would be best to check with you before proceeding on these revisions, as you may have legal requirements.

1. Walmart asks if it is OK to remove the CHOKING warning from the front panel, since it appears on the back. 

2. Walmart also asks if the “NOT A LIFESAVING DEVICE” statement can be moved to the side panels.


The more feedback we get from you, the better our work will be.
从观众那儿得到的反馈越多越好。
