- Sorry - need a little clarification before we start processing these.The files we received for Canada are in Almar style
packaging. Do you need us to proof these, add French, make sure they are compliant with Canadian requirements, and then route
to Walmart Canada? Or should these files be converted to Canada private label brand packaging?
