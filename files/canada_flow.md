## 加拿大新case流程：

1. We receive the kickoff list from packaging specialist<br>

2. We send a blank Packaging Form to the vendors from the kick off list (supplier has 10 days to return Packaging Form and die lines)<br>

3. Once we get packaging forms, die lines and other files back, we check to make sure data matches Kickoff<br>

4. If PF data matches kickoff form, then BMK sends both Packaging Form and kick off form to Walmart Canada packaging specialist, who will advise BMK to go to next step. (Rosemary／Wendy, and Greg)<br>
If data on PF does NOT match kick off form, BMK must then send both to Walmart Canada Packaging Team AND notify them of the discrepancy.<br>

5. After confirmation from Canada packaging specialist, BMK should prepare and send quotation to supplier (Supplier has 3 working days to sign back) Once supplier signs back…<br>

6. We prepare first draft art within 7 days of receiving signed quote, once ready…<br>

7. We route files via PHQ to Packaging Team only (Rosemary／Wendy, and Greg), and revise/re-route if they have any comments (Greg will be reviewer only. The approver should be the same packaging specialist who sent the kickoff) - ProofHQ deadline set for 24 hours (unless submitted on a Saturday)<br>

8. After one of Rosemary or Wendy approves, we then route the files to the packaging team once more, and add in the PD, buyer, and vendor  - ProofHQ deadline set for 24 hours (unless submitted on a Saturday)<br>

9. After PD+buyer+packaging specialist + vendor ALL approve, we then send to have the translations done, and add to the files once ready (also adding any photos if shot) <br>

10. We then route the files with French and final photography to PD+buyer+packaging specialist (there should be no changes aside from adding the French+photos) - ProofHQ deadline set for 24 hours (unless submitted on a Saturday)<br>

11. Upon approval, final art released<br>

## Notes
- Do not start work on anything without a kickoff list<br>
- If data in Packaging Form does not match kickoff, notify WMT packaging team of any discrepancy<br>
- Step 5 - if supplier does not sign back within 3 days, notify Walmart Canada<br>
- A slightly different process may apply to GV items we handle through Elizabeth’e team at the moment<br>
