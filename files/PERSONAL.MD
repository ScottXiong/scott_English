- Please double check, seems can't be scaned out. 扫码扫不出来
- Hello supplier - what exactly are you scanning from? The PDF is not hi-res, so it will not scan properly. The UPC bars themselves are an EPS file, when output on an imagesetter, will scan. It is not meant for on screen scanning, or printed on an office printer. 
- We feel confused about clean for control and battery. Could you please clarify? Regarding the colour of the photo, the current version is raw and low-res, the color maybe a bit of different. We'll replace it with high-res picture when we release the artwork to you.
- Don’t worry about it, we will push the schedule and have communicated with Raven. Here is one issue need you to confirm.
As for Raven’s comment, after checked the packaging form you provided. We found that the packaging type is Polybag with Poly Header. so we use opaque white per printed need. Could you please confirm the below 2 SKUs are in poly bags or in foil bags?
- We will make another 2 independent artworks when we release the final artwork to you. Now it's the beginning
of the process and it will be convenient for you and buyer to review.
- We just saw your comments on ProofHQ, please advise if your still have further comments, if not, please submit your decision. Also please confirm the Country of Origin of your items.
- check digit(Noted, but the check digit is 8 on our end which is different from 9 on your side,so please double check and confirm the UPC and make sure it’s correct.)
- Please note - we received the PDQs and boxes for lights. Normally suppliers are supposed to list the UPC numbers of the items that will be held in each PDQ on the art file of the PDQ, in large type, near the slug. It was not done on these files, but we have let it pass this time. Please be sure to do this on future files. We will add a comment requesting this on the next set of files that have PDQs. 
- “prove” is the wrong word here… better to say “confirm” or “verify”
- Have you receive the commit from Walmart? We just need to verify that,as we aren't allowed to send them until suppliers
have an actual commit. Sorry to trouble you.
