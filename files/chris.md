Hi team

I spoke to Justin on the phone last night. When we make some small change on the designs, like today's comments for SUW, I don't think we need to send back to them to approve it again. They get a bit angry, and think that wastes their time. So once we get their comments, we should immediately move to the next step. 

For this case, let me work with designers to make sure the revisions are correct. Once okay, we just send for French directly. And, when we get the French back we should still not send it back to Walmart. The next time we sent to Walmart, it should have French AND final photography. 

For GV, for these garbage bag projects and maybe other projects as well, Walmart wants to see the files as few times as possible. That is their goal. 

When I say Walmart I mean Maureen and those PD people or buyers. Of course Justin will see the files more times if needed. If we need to make any special change, we should send to Justin ONLY and get his feedback. 

Best if you check with me first going forward. So on these SUW files I will work with Michelle today, and after the files are okay, we send directly to translate, not back to Walmart Canada. After the French comes back, we add into the file, but again, do not send to Walmart Canada. We need to wait for the photos. Once we get the photos,then we can send back to Walmart for the final approval.

Please acknowledge your understanding - tks


Best Regards,
Christopher Corriden
