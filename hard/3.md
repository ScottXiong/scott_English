Marky
you mean one account can be used in several platform, right?
Me

That's right.
You can install or configure ExpressVPN on as many devices as you like (i.e., computers, mobile devices, streaming media consoles and wireless routers). With one subscription, you'll be able to connect up to 3 devices on any platform simultaneously.
Marky
sounds amazing
one more question:
Me

Sure.
Marky
how about the speed, I care more when I use google browser
Me

There are too many factors at play that such a number would be nearly impossible to quantify. The best thing I could recommend is to try out our service and then you can switch freely between some of the various server locations (especially those close to you) as well as the VPN protocols (available in the options menu).
Is there anything else I can help you with?
Marky
Is it serious for performance lag
Me

The higher your standard internet connection the more speed you lose in percentage. For example, if you have 5 mbps connection, you can lose just 10-20% of bandwidth, and if you have 100 mbps you can lose even more than a half of your connection if you connect to a VPN.
Marky
how about 4G networks with iPhone outdoors
Me

We can't reallly tell unless you try it.
Marky
tsk for your explanation. anyway, I will try
Me

Most high speed connections handle a minimum of 1.5 Mbps and may go up to 30 Mbps. In these cases the VPN speed won't be affected much, but anything less than this (as supplied by dial-up or 3G connections) can cause VPN connectivity issues.
Alright.
Is there anything else I can help you with?
Marky
everything seems ok except my worry about the speed outdoors when I just take an iPhone
Me

If you have a connection speed of more thatn 5mbps, then there should be less impact on your connection speed once connected to the VPN.
If you still need anything else, please contact us back. Thanks again for reaching out, and have a great day!
:)
Thank you for your feedback!
