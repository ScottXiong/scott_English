The upload speed is slow <br>
We do everything we can to make sure your transfers are at optimal speed on our side. If you're experiencing a slow upload, it most likely has something to do with your Internet service provider (ISP) or network connection or perhaps there is something blocking our connection from performing correctly. <br>

There are some things that you can do to ensure you are running at the fastest speed possible:<br>

Are you using any form of antivirus software? If so, please update this program before transferring. You should also turn off any webshield option in its settings and finally, turn off HTTP checking if your antivirus software uses that. <br>
There are several known problematic antivirus software: Avast, Bitdefender, ESET.<br>
If you're not using antivirus software, the slow speed could be caused by problems with your internet connection. Please check<br> if there is any software running that may be interrupting our service (think about extensions/plugins/toolbars you may have running in your browsers, such as ad blockers). You can also check if your firewall is blocking our service.<br>
You can read more about antivirus software and other blocking apps here.<br>

If you're using our service on a corporate network, you need to check with your system administrator if there are any limitations for using our service in your workplace. If necessary, ask them to contact us directly for technical support.<br>
If all else fails and you desperately trying to send your transfer in time (pesky deadlines!), you could also try your transfer on another browser. If this succeeds, this would suggest your browser's current settings are interfering with our connection. <br>
