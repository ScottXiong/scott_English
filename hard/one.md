Hi Boki,

Here is the story of these two PDQs:

D18EA_17083718_BabyRattle_CT170565-12_PDQ_R

1, On 09/09, you sent two PDQ dielines to us, one is for this PDQ with size of PDQ - 12in (length) x 15.5in (width) x 4.5in (front height & back height).
2, On 10/12, you sent an e-mail to us and told us to revise the price to $1.98.
3, On 10/23, you sent an e-mail to us and told us to change the VSN to CT170565-12 / CT170565-14.


D18EA_17083720_Animals_CT170565-12_PDQ_R

 1. On 10/24, you provided the die-line, in your e-mail you wrote PDQ size :23.5in x 14.5in x 3in - retail price :$5.98 - stock#1612-020Y-10  / 164-093-9.5 / FY166134-910 / Y21547W-E, but the actual die-lie (12in (length) x 15.5in (width) x 4.5in (front height & back height)) was different from what you described in e-mail.

2. Then we sent the draft artwork (D18EA_17083720_Animals_CT170565-12_PDQ_R) to you and notified the difference at the same day, and we got your reply with the answer to change the VSN to CT170565-12 / CT170565-14 on 10/30(2:20pm). 10 minutes later, we got another e-mail and you told us to change to retail price to  $ 1.98. So you get the current file D18EA_17083720_Animals_CT170565-12_PDQ_R. 

Then there are two same PDQs. So, one PDQ will be cancelled, please check. 

In your e-mail on10/23, you said PDQ size :23.5in x 14.5in x 3in - retail price :$5.98 - stock#1612-020Y-10  / 164-093-9.5 / FY166134-910 / Y21547W-E, I guess you want to add one PDQ for this size. If so, please provide the die-line.

Thanks & Best Regards
